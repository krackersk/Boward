Markdown knowledge base and document store for Boward Capital.

Any attachments for the markdown in the folder should be stored in .\attachments and have a relative path in the markdown.

If using Obsidian then make the following changes in:

'Settings' -> 'Files & Links'
-> 'New Link Format' = 'Relative to path'
-> 'Use wiki links' = off
-> 'Default location for new attachments' = 'In subfolder under current folder'
-> 'Subfolder name' = 'attachments'

While editing, always think of the bower.
