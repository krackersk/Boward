## Overview [2]
Injective’s mission is to create a truly free and inclusive financial system through decentralization.

With the fastest blockchain built for finance, and plug-and-play Web3 modules, Injective’s ecosystem is reshaping a broken financial system with dApps that are highly interoperable, scalable and truly decentralized.

## Team
Eric Chen - NYU, lots of experience, technically very competent [1], worked as a market maker in trad fi before starting on injective after realising how broken current system was. 

## Investors
Binance, Mark Cuban, Jump, Pantera
## Strategy
Thesis is curretnly that Derivatives are good  for retail. 
Ninja Ambassador program [5] - encourages users to retweet to build up social clout - might explain their social presence as it incentivises bot creation.  
They have internal market makers 


## History
Incubated by Binance labs in 2018. [2] Started off early when DEX's weren't a thing. Originally on Eth 0x. Then changed to Cosmos, then switched to Perps during FTX era. Thesis in 2020 was that derivatives were good for retail because allow hedging etc. Perps are the future, because can transact faster / less friction. [1] Pretty nimble. Plan was for a 60% of exchange fees to go to buyback [1]. With the Volan update, they are now cutting their inflation [3]. Switched to Batch auction [7]

## Technology

### Whitepaper 
Talks about verifiable delay functions (VDF) as a way of ensuring fair ordering. [6]
Perps

### Other technologies
Contract for Difference (expiry futures)
On chain orderbook
Real World Assets (RWA) [3]
Batch Auctions [7]
Permissioned gateway for institutional users (seems to undercut their 'democratizing finance' mission)
EVM
Partnership with Google Cloud via injective nexus [4] 
Pre-Launch Futures (e.g $TIA before launch)
Tokenized treasuries

## Roadmap

## Fundamentals
- Not much locked up as of [[2024-01-12]] (33 million)
- Doesn't show up on https://cryptofees.info/
- Helix Volumes look good though, daily ~60 million [2024-01-12](2024-01-12)
- https://hub.injective.network/auction look pretty healthy. Last 3 weeks have been 147, 137 and 130k USD each which is 60% of fees. so the actuals would be
- 245, 226, 216k  - compares to Osmosis 72k for 7days.
