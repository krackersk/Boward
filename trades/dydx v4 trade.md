# dydx v4 trade
#trade
## Rational
Dydx is the perpetual exchange with the most volume (current daily volume is around $500M). It is currently in public testnet with v4 cosmos app-chain. Plans to release in Sept.
### Theses
App chain thesis
Decentralised perpetuals vs centralised perps? - we currently don’t have a thesis around this
### Primary effects
### Secondary effects
All USDC funding for dydx v4 will be bridged Ethereum (USDC) -> Axlar (axlUSDC) -> Osmosis (cosmos native USDC) -> dydx chain
==How much funding do we expect?==
==How much is this compared to osmosis’s current volume?==
